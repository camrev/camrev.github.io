I am a post-doctoral researcher at the Geneva Graduate Institute, under the supervision of [Richard Baldwin](https://cepr.org/about/people/richard-baldwin) and [Marcelo Olarreaga](https://www.unige.ch/gsem/en/research/faculty/all/marcelo-olarreaga). 
I hold a PhD in international economics from the University of Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne and I was a Marie Curie Early-Stage Researcher in the framework of the Horizon 2020 Marie Curie network on European Union Trade and Investment Perspectives. 
My thesis is entitled « Essays on Regulatory Measures in International Trade » and was supervised by [Lionel Fontagné](http://www.lionel-fontagne.eu) and [Gianluca Orefice](https://sites.google.com/site/oreficegianluca/home). 

Before joining the University of Paris 1, I interned at the International Trade Centre (ITC) in Geneva, working on the non-tariff measures impeding trade in developing countries and as an international consultant in market research in ITC, developing a method assessing export potential value for trade in services. 

I also worked as an international consultant for the World Bank on a project assessing the impact of import ban in Sri Lanka, for a joint project between ADB and UNCTAD and for the International Standard Organisation. 

My research focuses on how international trade shapes policies, markets and firms.
